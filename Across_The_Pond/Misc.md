# Pieces Of Old
One of the assassin's after Sarazy called my dagger a piece of old.  These pieces of old are powerful relics that are said to have existed back in pre-history and very few historical documents, if any, remain.  The heroes of these myths were told to have powerful weapons, crafted and gifted by the gods, that they adventured and fought with.

Dragon's Dogma may be a piece of old.

The Blade of Lady Tanamere may also be a piece of old.
