# <u>TODO</u>

## <u>Dragon Outside Phandolin</u>
Has been stirring up other troubles in the area. Orcs pushed down from the mountains may cause conflicts back & forth. 

White dragon.  Young.

Dragon attacked Phandolin.


Darren Edermath tried to fight off the dragon, but it froze him then picked him up out of the ice and carried him off.

## <u>Orcs in the Area</u>
Possibly camped at Ice Spire Peak.

They camped out in the Dwarven Excavation, where Orob fell to them.

We have defeated the orcs at the Dwarven Excavation and learned that more may be to the southwest of Phandolin, where their children prisoners have been taken.

After returning Silvus, the half-orc child, to Neverwinter we learned that they often take orc children to the south of the Mere of Dead Men.  Somewhere in some mountains.

## <u>Save Orok</u>
We need to Save Orob's son Orok from the Orcs.  We know he's been taken south of the mere of dead men.

Orok Strife has been moved to Avanamere hold recently from the Woodland Manse when we had stopped by.

## <u>Neverwinter Fist Fights</u>
Every "Wednesday" at the beached leviathon.


## <u>Phandolin Coup</u>
We plan to help overthrow Harbin's rule of Phandolin.  He's a bad ruler and should be replaced.  

Linene asked that we talk with her about this after taking care of the dragon.


## <u>Underdark Entrances</u>
1. In Neverwinter in the scarred distrcit, there is an entrance to the underdark.


# <u>Completed</u>

## <u>The Anchorites of Talos</u>
The Logger's camp was cursed by the Anchorites who passed through a few days/weeks ago.

The anchorites of Talos, mostly made up of half-orcs, have been helping the Orcs in the area steal child orcs and half-orcs.  Falcon from the Falcon's Lodge would like us to get rid of the anchorites in the area.

There was sorcerer who used to work there studying the ruins, (NAME UNKNOWN).  He may have notes there about the ruins that would be useful and/or information about his wearabouts or fate.

The Falcon just thinks the Anchorites are a thorn in his side and he would like to be rid of them.

The Anchorites are at The Woodland Manse, about 10 miles East of The Falcon Lodge.

We killed the orcs at the Woodland Manse.

We found a piece of a leather satchel that had a map to an area called the Circle of Thunder.

There was also a set of runes in the ground that said "Falcon's Hunting Lodge".

We captured an Anchorite of Talos and from the Woodland Manse.  They recognized my blade, and said that by the morning they will have summoned the Thunder Boar. 

Gorthak, the Thunder Boar, is one of Talos's generals.  They plan to take down the Falcon Lodge, then "retake their heritage".

We killed Gorthak, and took out the orc horde attacking the Hunting Lodge.


## <u>Logger's Camp Delivery</u>
Take a shipment from Barthen's up to the loggers camp east of Neverwinter.

Harbin's brother, Tybur, runs the loggers camp.

Note: There are perishables in this shipment!

The loggers have been attacked by Tremor's like creatures.  Harbin's brother has been trapped for 3 days and is the last survivor.  He won't come out until we kill all of the creatures.

We find some references to Talos - a bundle of stick figures with a lightning bolt and bundled around some hair.  These figures were meant to bring ill fortune to anyone nearby.  Some Talos follower cursed this village.

Kalimb killed Tybur and Keremy mutilated the corpse.  We burned the village to hide the evidence.

## <u>Weird Dreams</u>
Jack and his neighbors have been having scary dreams for the last few days.  He thinks they may be magical in nature.  He last saw a dream of himself in the sewers with an angel statue.

We found an angel statue in the sewers nearby.  There was a book in the statue with the following message written in infernal: 
"All salvation comes through order.  The passage opens at our command."

Above the statue it says:
"Infernal alphabet repeating"

There were illusioned gems that became coal when removed.  The gems are:
There are 1 amethys, 13 garnets, 19 sapphires, 15 pieces of jade, 19 citrine, 5 quartz, 21 rubies, and 4 pieces of onyx.

Amethys Citrine Garnet Jade Onyx Quarts Rubies Sapphire
A C  G  J  O  Q  R   S 
1 19 13 15 4  5  21  19
A S  M  O  D  E  U   S

The abdjuration on the statue is similar to the arcane lock spell.

We spoke ASMODEUS and the statue opened.

Going through the opening, we found some spined devils and then later a succubus and cambion.  After defeating them we left the sewers.

We recieved our potions and preservative from Jack.

## <u>Selling the Blade</u>
Jack found a buyer for Dragon's Dogma.  They were oddly excited for this purchase.

They offered 5000g, Jack counter offered with the magic ring we saw him with on our way to Neverwinter.

We did not want to lose Jack as a shop so we countered with 20,000g.  The sale is off.

## <u>Return the Half-Orc Child</u>
We found a half-orc child, Silvus, who had been taken by some Eyes of Gruumsh in preparation to turn him into a new Eye of Gruumsh.  He is from Neverwinter and his parents may provide a reward for his return.

We returned Silvus and received 80 silver for our trouble.  Silvus also told us that there is an army of orcs where they take young orc children south of the Mere of Deadmen.

## <u>The Blade of Lady Tanamere</u>
Lady Tanamere Allagundar - Old hero who lived ages ago, a powerful warrior who lived during past Dragon Ages.  She had a powerful blade, and slew dragons as they rose to power.  Buried ceremoniously with her compatriots.  Burial place was lost to time.


Pieces of old are mentioned. Dragon's Dogma is a piece of old.  The blade of lady tanamere is also a piece of old.


Burial mound at Dragon Barrow in the shape of a dragon off the path to the East on the way to Neverwinter.


The Blade of Lady Tanamere was MADE to slay dragons.

- Nearby the barrow, we found a group of Eyes of Gruumsh searching for the blade.  It sounds like the blade had something to do with their god.

- We met Lady Tanamere's skeleton horse who said he would follow the owner of her blade.

- We defeated the spirit of Lady Tanamere and retrieved the blade.

## <u>Phandolin's Backup Plan</u>
Old Dwarven Fortress south of Phandolin called Axelholm.

Open up and clear out the fortress so that the towns people could have a fortress to retreat to.

250g upon clearing out.


Axelholm has been cleared up!!

## <u>Escort the Mine Overseet</u>
Escort Don John Raskin  to the Mountain Toe's Goldmine.
100g from Townmaster on completion. 


We took care of the wererats inhabiting the mine.


Get reward from Halia.

## <u>Deadly Lighthouse</u>
West of Phandolin there is a lighthouse that causes ships to crash on the rocks. 

Check out the lighthouse.

Check out the crashed ships with some gold.


Snippy the crab will get treasure for us if we free his master's soul.


The master's soul haunts the cave near the lighthouse - she will be free if the conch is found and returned to her.


Lighthouse is watched over by Talos, god of Storms.


I desecrated the alter so Storm god is cleansed. We got all the items from the ships.

## <u>Magic at Gnomengarde</u>
Harbin Wester wants magic to help fend off the dragon.  He will buy magic we find in Gnomengard.


We still have the magic wizard's hat from here, but screw selling that to Harbin!


So Keremy killed the kings.....
