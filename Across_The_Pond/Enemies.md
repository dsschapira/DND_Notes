# <u>Sarazy's Assassins</u>
A Tiefling and a Dragonborn.  They killed Halia and attacked the party.  They were after Sarazy.  The dragonborn knew my dagger as a "Piece of Old".

# <u>Phandolin Dragon - DECEASED</u>
Young White Dragon. Named Cryovain.

Dim Witted.  Many have out smarted it.

Flies around anywhere on the sword coast.  Sighted all over.  More common and reckless.

They think it's at Ice Spire Peak up in the mountains.

White dragons prefer cold.

The Dragon has a 30ft. cone breath attack that is devastating.

On our first meeting near the Triboar Trail 2 of our party were downed outright, though we fought off the dragon and survived the battle.

There are very often blizzard-like weather effects around their lair.  They often get stronger when the dragon is asleep.

We killed the dragon in his lair at Ice Spire Hold.

# <u>Galadur - DECEASED</u>
Eye of Gruumsh orc half orc who grew up in Connyberry.  He was taken in the raid that destroyed the Shrine of Savras.  He was held in The Ice Spire hold and put through trials. Eventually went through a prep of Eye of Gruumsh making.  Sent some others to strongholds to south and west (near waterdeep - south of main map).
