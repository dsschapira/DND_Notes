# <u>Phandolin Dragon</u>
White Dragon.

Dim Witted.  Many have out smarted it.

Flies around anywhere on the sword coast.  Sighted all over.  More common and reckless.

They think it's at Ice Spire Peak up in the mountains.


White dragons prefer cold.

# <u>Sarazy's Assassins</u>
A Tiefling and a Dragonborn.  They killed Halia and attacked the party.  They were after Sarazy.  The dragonborn knew my dagger as a "Piece of Old".

# <u>Galadur - DECEASED</u>
Eye of Gruumsh orc half orc who grew up in Connyberry.  He was taken in the raid that destroyed the Shrine of Savras.  He was held in The Ice Spire hold and put through trials. Eventually went through a prep of Eye of Gruumsh making.  Sent some others to strongholds to south and west (near waterdeep - south of main map).
