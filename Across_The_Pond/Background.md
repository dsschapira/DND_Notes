# Backstory
At the young age of 16, Kalimb found himself stuck in the material realm, separated from his home in the Feywilds with no direction on how to return.  Scared and alone, he stumbled to a nearby cave to later be found by a Dark Elf coming to the surface to trade.  The Drow took him in and raised him as a Dark Elf.  As he grew, his confusion over why he was cast out slowly began to turn to bitter anger.  He now hates the Archfey who rule the Feywilds and plans one day, to return to the Feywilds and claim the throne.

His anger was sensed by the Fiend Glasya who, unbeknownst to Kalimb, decided to use him as a pawn in an ongoing struggle between the Fiends and Archfey.

Also unknown to Kalimb, it was Hyrsam, the Archfey who was behind his, and the other eladrins', dismissal from the Feywilds. Hyrsam's motives are yet unknown.

After 50 years in the Underdark, Kalimb decided it was time to begin looking for a way to amass power to return to his home.  He spent years searching for a weapon, a spell, anything that could help.  He finally, one day, felt a tug toward a forgotten shelf tucked away behind a shrine to lolth. 



There was a tome describing a dagger that would imbue it's wielder with fiery power to destroy any and all of their enemies.  It was said to have slain thousands, even millions, throughout the eras. 



The dagger would be known by its intricate hilt which has three dragon heads.  Two on the hand guard, with ruby eyes, and mouths that can open and spit fire.  The third is the hand guard with a golden scale belly, grasping a ruby, and eyes perpetually spewing a heat-less fire.  The scale of the dragons is onyx.


Kalimb tracked the dagger through the history books.  It was known by many names, but most notably Dragon's Dogma.  After 30 years of searching, Its last known location was the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms. 


Kalimb recovered Dragon's Dogma and has begun to grow more powerful and closer with the dagger.


While becoming closer with the dagger he began to be called to some Fiendish realm.  Granted further power by some unknown Hellish diety, he has begun to do her bidding in an effort to gain more power.

NOTE: Gonna go for that Zuko arc.
